### Alpine Grading System

The peak carries a PD+ grade under the Alpine Grading System. This reflects moderate difficulty with portions of the route necessitating climbing equipment and basic technical skills.

### Main Technical Sections

The stretch from High Camp to the summit is the most demanding. Narrow, icy ridgelines and steep ascents require use of crampons, ice axes, and a solid understanding of rope techniques. Seasonal weather changes, including snow, wind, or unstable terrain, can add to the challenge.

### Altitude-Related Concerns

At over 6,000 meters, climbers face significant risks of altitude sickness. Gradual acclimatization is vital, and most climbing itineraries include designated rest and adaptation days at higher elevations.
